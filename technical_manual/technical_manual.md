##Introduction

###Overview
For our Third year project we decided to design a POS Application, which we called Order 66. Order 66 is an application aimed at Resturants,Bars and Cafes that will accompany and in the future replace your current till system. Order 66 uses a website admin interface which will allow an employer create his menu for his resturant/bar/cafe, add all his employee details so he can easily manage their accounts, automatically create reports lastly have access to helpful usage statistics. Employee's can also download our Andoird Application which will allow employee's to create orders using the menu their employer has created and send orders so all other employee's can view them and start preparing them seconds after it has been sent.

Order 66 has many benefits for both the employer and the employee as it can help improve efficency in the workplace which can in turn can provide greater returns for the employer. Not to mention making the employee's life that much easier as they won't have to worry about forgetting what was in each order, what order went to what table and did I tell me co-workers about the last order.
