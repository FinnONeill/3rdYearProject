##Introduction

###Overview
For our Third year project we decided to design a POS Application, which we called Order 66. Order 66 is an application aimed at Resturants,Bars and Cafes that will accompany and in the future replace your current till system. Order 66 uses a website admin interface which will allow an employer create his menu for his resturant/bar/cafe, add all his employee details so he can easily manage their accounts, automatically create reports lastly have access to helpful usage statistics. Employee's can also download our Andoird Application which will allow employee's to create orders using the menu their employer has created and send orders so all other employee's can view them and start preparing them seconds after it has been sent.

Order 66 has many benefits for both the employer and the employee as it can help improve efficency in the workplace which can in turn can provide greater returns for the employer. Not to mention making the employee's life that much easier as they won't have to worry about forgetting what was in each order, what order went to what table and did I tell me co-workers about the last order.

##Problems and Resolution

-Major problems encountered (WiFi P2P)

### WiFi P2P

After our initial design and research we intended to use android's native WiFi P2P libary, that would allow us to be able to send data between two devices that are connected by a Local Area Network, this can also be achieved by using a mobile devices ability to create a hotspot, which would act as the Local Area Network. The issues we encounterd was that the WiFi P2P libary is a recent addition to the android framework and was previously called Android Beam meaning that only devices from API level 14 or higher would be capable of using the service. 

Another issue we came accross was that the P2P services acts similarly to a bluetooth connection as it uses WPS for security and as a result needs the user to hit accept for each file transfer.

Another issue which was the most major was the once two devices were connected, one device would become the group owner and would act as the server while the rest would act as clients. The problem was that the group owner was only able to receive files and to become the group owner, you would have to disconnect and reconnect, meaing the user would have to accept the connection again which wasn't practical as if a waitress wanted to send an order to the kitchen, she could but then to get any updates on the staus of the order, the waitress would have to accept the connection from the kitchen each time they wanted to change the order status. 

Lastly disconnecting from a group was not very consistant as the group was only destroyed after the group owner disconnected and the connection timeout was reached. This meant that users would may have tried to disconnect to an empty group while the other user may create a new group or their Status would change from available to either busy and wouldn't be able to be found by the searching devices.

Our solution to these issues was to try an alternative method, which resulted in the application requring an Internet connection to be able to function. We used the HTTP POST request to run PHP files on a server that would handle accessing and storing all our data on a MYSQL Server.
