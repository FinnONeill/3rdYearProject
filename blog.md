Title: Getting Started

Date: 11/02/2017

What I have done so far, last week I created the file structure for the website, did all of the HTML and started on the CSS. I have done the website design and know what I want it to look like. We just have to decide on a colour scheme that will run throughout our entire project. 

Today I also made a start on creating my first android application that uses WiFi Direct.
